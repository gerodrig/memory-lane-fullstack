          Memory Lane Home Living is looking for help in the form of volunteers to be on committees (i.e., fundraising, program support, music or art therapists ) and/or on the Board of Directors with experience in social media, senior care and recreation therapy, fundraising or  finance. We are looking for people who ideally have a lived experience with dementia or a passion to improve the lives of those living with a dementia and their families.

          at MLHL we are blessed to work with many wonderful volunteers üíó . This year`s volunteer appreciation theme is ‚ÄúVolunteering weaves us together!‚Äù It strengthens the fabric of our community by those sharing their time, talent and energy to support one another. 
          </p>

          <p className={styleSection.description}>
          We hope to attract persons who already have experience as volunteers. Most importantly, though, we need people who are ready to help and to work as a member of a team. If you have a few hours a week that you can give to help us please <span><Link
